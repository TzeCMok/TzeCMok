## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Tze Chung, a data science enthusiast currently learning in a bootcamp hosted by CoHrammar & HyperionDev. 

I'm originally from Hong Kong, where I spent five years as a programmer working with Java and SAP Commerce.  While I'm still getting used to the Pythonic way of doing things, I'm excited to learn more about data. 

Feel free to check out my projects and let's connect!
